# Popular Movies App Stage 1

## Description

In this stage youâ€™ll build the core experience of your movies app.

You app will:

* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
 * The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated

* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
 * original title
 * movie poster image thumbnail
 * A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
 * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
 * release date

## What Will I Learn After Stage 1?
* You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
* You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
* You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write

## theMovieDB API Key
The API Key should be injected via Gradle properties.
