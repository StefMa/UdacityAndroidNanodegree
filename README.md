This is a copy from [this](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code/commit/0c3e8376031bbce688a206fe70d3ddb7355e358b) repository.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.

## User Feedback for XYZ Reader:
Lyla says:
> “This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

Jay says:
> “Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

Kagure says:
> “The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
