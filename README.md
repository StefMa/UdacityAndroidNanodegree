# UdacityAndroidNanodegree
This project contains all tasks which I have to solve in my Android Nanodegree at Udacity.

## About the repo
The `master` branch contains only **this** README. 
All other projects are resident in another branch.

If I have to create a new task a new branch will be created with 
```
git checkout --orphan new-branch-name
```
> Branch names should be in named with dashes!

All projects should be linked in the table below ðŸ‘‡

## Rules
To provide some consistency I have some rules which should* be applied for **all** projects:

Each project:
* has a README which quickly explain what it is and what was todo
* has only one single commit with the message `Init commit`
* has a compile & targetSdkVersion of `27`
* has a minSdkVersion of `21`
* has at least the following dependencies: [`appcompat-v7`, `constraint-layout`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/setup.html), [`recyclerview`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview.html)
* has at least the following test-dependencies: [`junit`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit/), [`mockito-core`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-core), [`assertj-core`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.assertj/assertj-core)
* has at least the follwoing android-test-dependencies: [`runner`, `rule`](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/instrumented-unit-tests.html) (as well as the test-dependencies of course)

> *Not all projects will strictly follow these rules. Bust most of them!

After a project is finished and submitted it has to be added to the projects table below.
