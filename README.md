# UdacityAndroidNanodegree
This project contains all tasks which I have to solve in my Android Nanodegree at Udacity.

## About the repo
The `master` branch contains only **this** README. 
All other projects are resident in another branch.

If I have to create a new task a new branch will be created with 
```
git checkout --orphan new-branch-name
```
> Branch names should be in named with dashes!

All projects should be linked in the table below ðŸ‘‡
